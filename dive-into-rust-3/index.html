  <h1 class="post-title">Dive Into Rust - An awesome day at LHC, Campinas</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2017-11-06</span>
  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Mozilla promotes Rust communities worldwide, here in Brazil
Mozilla Rep <a href="https://geraldobarros.me/">Geraldo Barros</a>
came to the users forum looking for a facilitator for a series of workshops.
I jumped at the opportunity and together with an awesome team of volunteers we've
already made three workshops happen, two in São Paulo and the latest one in Campinas,
which this post is about. We have more planned,
the people at Belo Horizonte can't wait for their workshop on December 9th!</p>
<h2 id="diving-into-rust">Diving into Rust</h2>
<p>My role is to prepare the materials and flow beforehand and help out
on the day so that the participants are be able to make the most out of the workshop.
Having the experience of the two previous workshops, I learned that 5 hours was a short time
and made the flow as leaner. The current flow goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction to Rust, keynote to motivate people.</li>
<li>Two basic exercises.</li>
<li>Keynote on ownership.</li>
<li>Exercises on making the compiler happy and why you should also be happy when you do it.</li>
<li>Structs and enums.</li>
<li>If there is time, talk about threads.</li>
<li>Talk about the community and try to get someone to write a blog post (didn't work this time so here I am).</li>
</ol>
<p>For each exercise there is an initial live coding demo, about 10 minutes to hack on the exercise and
then solve it together or just show and discuss a solution depending on how many people solved it.
I try to have unit tests along with the exercises so that the participants can know when they solved it.
The material is available <a href="https://github.com/mozillabrasil/dive-into-rust">here</a>
if you want to practice your Portuguese.</p>
<h2 id="the-place">The Place</h2>
<p>Campinas is a center of technological development in Brazil, with great universities and
major national and multinational technology companies. I also happen to live here.
<a href="https://lhc.net.br/wiki/P%C3%A1gina_principal">LHC</a> is not a hadron collider
but a very cool hackerspace which kindly
provided us the space and the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/rogeriofoxbr">Rogério Fox</a>
got everything organized.</p>
<h2 id="the-event">The Event</h2>
<p>Around 20 people showed up and we actually ran out of desks (sorry guys at the bench).
The participants were mostly experienced programmers and I learned a lot from them.
A few people were less experienced and got stuck early,
but they managed not to get too frustrated and moved along with the exercises.</p>
<h2 id="the-pictures">The Pictures</h2>
<p><a href="focused.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="focused.jpg" alt="Everyone focused on work."></a></p>

<p><a href="focused2.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="focused2.jpg" alt="Everyone typing."></a></p>
<p><a href="everyone.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="everyone.jpg" alt="Everyone happy they learned Rust."></a></p>
<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>
<p>Getting explicit give feedback can be difficult. But I believe the
workshop succeeded in getting them excited about the language and in giving the exposure
and basic working knowledge they need to smooth out the learning curve.</p>
<p>I took some lessons of improvement for the next iterations,
in particular: talking more about advantages of not having a GC,
focus on polymorphism with structs and enums and throwing traits in the mix.</p>
<p>Some people were involved in exciting projects:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jvff">Janito</a> is turning the <a href="http://www.lnls.cnpem.br/">LNLS</a>, our Brazilian particle accelerator,
into a friend of Rust. He's using Tokio to test scientific equipment over the network. He's implementing
a bunch of protocols and complicated stuff, he reports a good experience so far!</p>
<p>Professor Orlando Draderedo is very interested in how Rust combines formal elegance with pragmatic concerns
and will sneak some Rust into his programming languages class.</p>
<p>The people at LHC are excited about using Rust in embedded systems, they knew more about it than I did
and chatted for a long time about this subject.</p>
<p>A big goal is to get the participants involved in our local community, which consists of
our very active <a href="https://t.me/rustlangbr">Telegram group</a> and projects such as a weekly hangouts study group
and the <a href="https://github.com/rust-br/rust-book-pt-br/">translation of The Book</a>. Only about three
people joined the group, but one of them helped out with the book and they all participate every now and then,
so it was definitely a win for the community.</p>
<p>A big thanks to all organizers and participants, let's keep on Rusting!</p>
