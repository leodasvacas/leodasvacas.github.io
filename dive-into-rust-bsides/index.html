  <h1 class="post-title">Dive Into Rust at Bsides São Paulo</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2018-06-04</span>
  <p>After the huge <a href="http://roadshow.rustbr.org/">Rust Roadshow Brasil 2018</a>,
I was looking for new opportunities to talk about Rust.
I gave a talk at this year's <a href="https://cryptorave.org/">Cryptorave</a> and
now Security Bsides - São Paulo was a great chance to reach one of
Rust's target audience, security-minded developers.</p>
<h1 id="the-event">The event</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.securitybsides.com">Security BSides</a> describes itself as
a &quot;community-driven framework for building events for and by information
security community members&quot;, it seeks to make opportunities for the community
to meet outside of the more traditional big conferences.
This was my first contact with a BSides event,
it is a great example of the power of distributed community building!</p>
<p><a href="http://sp15.securitybsides.com.br/">BsidesSP</a> was at it's 0xF (15th) edition, and spanned two days, 19 and 20 of May. The <a href="http://sp15.securitybsides.com.br/agenda.html">agenda</a>
was very diverse, from regular talks to career fairs and hacking events. The first
day was entirely dedicated to four workshops, a conference format that I found interesting,
and one of those was our Dive Into Rust workshop.</p>
<h1 id="preparing-the-material">Preparing the material</h1>
<p>Though I've become experienced in doing these workshops and was accustomed to handling our
<a href="https://github.com/mozillabrasil/dive-into-rust">workshop flow</a>, it's always a challenge.
This time I had only 3 hours for a workshop that usually takes 5 hours to get through.
So I cut out the structs &amp; enums section, and kept only the basic exercises and the ownership
exercises, and ended up taking 2h30, without breaks. I also overhauled my slides based on the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksirw1v5gXk">Reach Further</a> Rust talk, which I had the privilege
of seeing in person at an <a href="https://gurusp.org/encontros/48-encontro-guru-sp-e-rustlangbr-na-totvs">event last month</a>, and added some
security-focused slides.</p>
<h1 id="the-place">The place</h1>
<p>The location was provided by PUC São Paulo, a major university with many campi in São Paulo.
The Consolação campus takes almost an entire block in a central region of São Paulo.
The organization was very helpful in helping me get set up and finding extension cords
so that the participants could charge their notebooks. Although we did not have internet connectivity, the participants managed fine with their mobile internet.</p>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>We got five participants, fewer than expected, but they were interested and engaged with the
workshop. They were all developers but most did not work with security. The initial exercises
were easy for most, but I think in the ownership section they learned a bit not only about Rust
but also about how computers and languages handle memory in general,
so I hope they felt it was worth it.</p>
<p>We always seek to make the participants active members of the community by joining our
<a href="https://t.me/rustlangbr">Telegram group</a>. None of them did this time so we could not
keep in touch, but I hope that they consider using Rust for their future projects.</p>
<p>The event was small but still a success, a huge thanks to Mozilla and
Mozilla Rep <a href="https://geraldobarros.me/">Geraldo Barros</a> for the support and to the
event organizers for accepting my talk and making the event happen.</p>
<p>I forgot to take pictures of the workshop this time, so I'll leave you with this cool
collage of pictures found at the facebook page of the event.</p>
